 software then  run or say power largest company, encrtpy data
, download the source code
Facebook UI, Google android system

You can take it as a core or a base


Several software are made by people, communities, & tech companies


Let say some one made a product, and other can see code fix the bug and be a contributor of it


But that was never the case earlier, microsoft made windows under the intelluctual rights

Now open-source has taken almost every project from walmart,  to erizon

Now microsoft has changed all their prospective & is the highest contributor of open source


In 1970 MIT labs (richard starmalin )

He made such a code like whenever their is a problem occurs it will send a message saying fix the printer

(New printer : ) his code was not good for other so he asked for it and was refused

So me made GNU OS


Then come the biggest game changer in year 1991 - Linux Trovold made Linux from GNU 
adopted it and made changes as per need

Now nasa, dell are using it for their servers maintaince & satellites


Note - almost 10,000 lines are changed for linux everyday



-----------
proper doesn't support reverse engineering
wordpress : 26% of websites
vlc
firefox



-----------
whenver comapy make a project it depends on them they want to make it open source or close source (properirty)

close is stable with cost ()
wait for creator to change the bug


Mysql , perl apache web server.


2008 google released android run on modified version of linux . Marketing was booming at that time

navigation, or any smart car you have more codes then it is given to any normal phone


Like we all are making so much code - there should be platform for everyone to collaborate with projects

So again a game changer in market github with a ans : 


Microsoft acquire gihub in 2018

Walmart open source cloud management platform
Goldman sac open source data modeling program



How monetize is done like when project is given free : 

subscription, commercial version
RedHat come with first market strategy as they provide support service to enterprise (red hat enterprise linux)


IBM acquire redHat (largest software acquistion)



Like mulesoft, mongoDB provide basic feature for free other are properitery


Lot of them are voluteers. 

issue also come ssl
now sponsers are their







Window use gitbash
other git 


---------------

Git vs GitLab :

Git is version control system



after acquire people think that open source roots

GitLab :  Git based repositiry hosting platform (2011)

to distuingh with GitHUb (made single product for whole devops lifecycle )

		issue tracker
		continuos intergration & delivery are part of product

comapnies like IBM, sony , alibaba



-----------

similarities & diffeence

both have public & private (Github - public free , private charge)
Gitlab unlimitated both (charge for usuage for DEVOPs tools)   -> give permisssion with issue tracker without giving whole permission


Github can use issue, CICD pipleline with plugin (need to update)



---------
which to choose : Git good for open source, devopers with github(interface is also fast)
Gitlab - self host or looking 


-----------

Source controlling problem : merging code from 2 different machine into single for new code
